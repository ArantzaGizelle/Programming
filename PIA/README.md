# GEOMETRIC CALCULATOR

###### Demonstrative video of its operation:
        
        https://youtu.be/2DCFlixyOHs
        
## Description: 
With the help of this program you can calculate the perimeter or area of any two-dimensional geometric figure that you prefer.

###### The geometric figures can be:

      1.Standard polygon 
      -  Square
      -  Triangle
      -  Circle
      -  Trapezoid
      -  Rectangle
      -  Rhombus
      -  Polygon with +5 sides
   
     2.Non-standard

## Design: 
This programme will also be designed to be useful especially for young children who will be seeing these topics from primary
school onwards and will be essential for their studies.

## Compilation process:

###### Order:

        1. < main.c >   ,  2.  < estandar.h >   , 3. < no_estandar.h >
        
## Instruction:

    (1) First you will select what kind of figure you want to calculate (standard or non-standard).
    
    (2.1) Standard:
       
       (3.1) select your geometric figure to evaluate.
       
       (4.1) The user will give the data that are necessary to be able to calculate the area and perimeter of the proposed figure.
    
    (2.2) Non-Standard:
        
        (3.2) Introduce to the program the value of each side of the figure not standard ,to be able to calculate its perimeter.
        
        (4.2) Write only the figures that make up your geometric figure, The figures you don’t need just add a zero.
