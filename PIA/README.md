# GEOMETRIC CALCULATOR

## Demonstrative video of its operation:      


  [you tube video](https://youtu.be/2DCFlixyOHs).


## Description: 
With the help of this program you can calculate the perimeter or area of any two-dimensional geometric figure that you prefer.

###### THE GEOMETRIC FIGURES CAN BE:

1.Standard polygon :

   -  Square
   -  Triangle
   -  Circle
   -  Trapezoid
   -  Rectangle
   -  Rhombus
   -  Polygon with +5 sides
   
 2.Non-standard

## Design: 
This programme will also be designed to be useful especially for young children who will be seeing these topics from primary
school onwards and will be essential for their studies.

## Compilation process:

###### Order:

        1. < main.c >   ,  2.  < estandar.h >   , 3. < no_estandar.h >
        
## Instruction:

(1) First you will select what kind of figure you want to calculate (standard or non-standard).
    
(2.1) Standard:
       
     (3.1) select your geometric figure to evaluate.
       
     (4.1) The user will give the data that are necessary to be able to calculate the area and perimeter of the proposed figure.
    
(2.2) Non-Standard:
        
     (3.2) Introduce to the program the value of each side of the figure not standard ,to be able to calculate its perimeter.
        
     (4.2) Write only the figures that make up your geometric figure, The figures you don’t need just add a zero.

## Self-evaluation:

- [x] 1: Complexity 2 (In my opinion the level of difficulty of this program is greater since when wanting to calculate a figure not standard there is no formula defined and the program would have to solve it in a more creative way so there are no programs similar to this one for its complexity in that aspect)
- [x] 2: Functionality 3 (Gives accurate and user-friendly results  )
- [x] 3: code 2 (Is organized and understandable with comments to guide the viewer )
- [x] 4: Storage 2 (It is adequate for the operation that the user needs to perform)
- [x] 5: Documentation 3 (It complies with the request and the duration of the video is exact)
