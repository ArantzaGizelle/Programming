# CALCULATOR OF AREAS AND PERIMETERS OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES

## Description: 
With the help of this program you can calculate the perimeter or area of any two-dimensional geometric figure you prefer.

 _The geometric figures can be:_

###### Perimeter:
   - Standard polygon
   - Non-standard polygon 
###### Area:
   - Standard polygon
   - Non-standard polygon

## Instruction:
    (1) First select if you want to calculate a perimeter or an area 
    
    (2.1) Perimeter:
       
       (3.1) select your geometric figure to evaluate, it could be Standard polygon or Non-standard polygon 
       
       (4.1) You will give value to each side of the polygon to be calculated
    
    (2.2) Area:
        
        (3.2) You will select your geometric figure to evaluate 
        
        (4.2) You will enter the requested data depending on your choice of geometric figure
